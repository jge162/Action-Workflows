## Purpose of this repository:

>[!IMPORTANT]\
>This is a template for copying simple-to-use GitHub actions, designed for the initial setup of any repository.

## Example action to run a `python.py` file to verify that no errors exist in your code:

>[!NOTE]\
>If errors exist within the code they'll be listed in the actions console.
>Also you can run more than one file, by separating them using commas.
   
## You decide on which triggers to use for `push` and `pull_request.`

>[!NOTE]\
>Also, a good trigger to use is also `workflow_dispacth`, to manually run the action.
 
```yaml
name: Run Python file
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Python Action
      uses: jge162/Action-workflows@v2.1.0
      with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_SECRET }}

    - run: |
        echo "Install required dependencies" 
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3
```         
    
## Lastly use a `for` loop to run multiple instances of Python scripts.

>This way you can run one, or multiple python scripts.

```yaml
     - run: |
        echo "Run, Build Application using scripts"
        python3 -c "
        scripts = ['./script.py', './script2.py'] 
        for script in scripts:
            with open(script, 'r') as file:
                exec(file.read())
```
