>This is **Repository** is a template for copying simple-to-use GitHub actions, designed for the initial setup of any repository.

>[!NOTE]\
>GitHub Action test case below: If errors exist within the code they'll be listed in the actions console.
>Also you can run more than one file, by separating them using commas.
>A good trigger to use is also `workflow_dispatch:`, to manually run the action.
